# BuddyDash

**Fast, polished mobile companion for Bambuddy.**

BuddyDash is an unofficial Android companion app for Bambuddy, built to make managing your Bambu printers feel faster, cleaner, and more mobile-friendly.

Think of BuddyDash as:

> a better mobile dashboard for Bambuddy

not a replacement for it.

Whether you run a single printer or a small farm, BuddyDash focuses on fast status checks, cleaner printer management, NFC quick actions, smart outlet control, and a premium mobile experience.

## What is BuddyDash?

BuddyDash connects to your existing Bambuddy server and gives you a fast, mobile-first experience for everyday printer management.

It is intentionally focused on:

* 🚀 Fast at-a-glance status
* 🖨️ Multi-printer usability
* 📱 Fold & tablet-friendly layouts
* 🏷️ NFC-powered quick actions
* ⚡ Smart outlet integration
* ✨ Premium, low-friction UX

BuddyDash intentionally does **not** expose every Bambuddy feature.

Instead, it focuses on the workflows that make sense in a clean mobile experience.

Less menu diving.
Less friction.
More glanceability.

## Important: Bambuddy Required

BuddyDash is **not standalone**.

You must already have:

* A running Bambuddy server
* Bambu printers configured in Bambuddy

BuddyDash uses Bambuddy as its backend and connects directly to your existing instance.

If you are not already using Bambuddy, start there first.

## Installation

### Beta APK

Download the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/unf0rg0tt3n/BuddyDash/releases).

1. Download the `BuddyDash-*.apk` file
2. Install it on your Android device
3. Open BuddyDash
4. Configure your Bambuddy server URL and API key
5. Printers and spools populate automatically

---

## Releases & Automated Builds

BuddyDash includes a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow that automatically builds, tests, and packages APKs.

### How Versioning Works
The app version is dynamically resolved during Gradle builds:
* `versionName`: The public version string shown in Settings (e.g. `0.9.1`, `1.0.0`, or `0.9.0-beta+<run>.<sha>`).
* `versionCode`: An integer incremented automatically based on git commit depth to ensure clean Android package upgrades.

### Creating a New Release (via Git Tag)
To publish a new official version and release APK:
```bash
# 1. Create a semantic version tag (prefixed with 'v')
git tag v0.9.1

# 2. Push the tag to GitHub
git push origin v0.9.1
```
GitHub Actions will automatically:
1. Run all unit tests (`./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`).
2. Build the APK with version `0.9.1`.
3. Create a GitHub Release titled **BuddyDash v0.9.1** with automatic release notes.
4. Attach `BuddyDash-0.9.1.apk` as a downloadable asset.

### Building On-Demand (Manual Trigger)
You can trigger a build anytime without creating a git tag:
1. Go to **Actions** → **Build Android APK** in your GitHub repository.
2. Click **Run workflow**.
3. *(Optional)* Enter a custom version name (e.g. `0.9.2-test`) or custom version code.
4. Download the resulting APK from the workflow run's **Artifacts** section.

### Local Development Builds
To build and test the APK locally:
```bash
# Run unit tests
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest

# Assemble debug APK with custom version
./gradlew assembleDebug -PversionName="0.9.1" -PversionCode="2"
```

---

## Setup

Open **Settings** and configure:

* Bambuddy server URL
* API key
* Camera / cover token (optional)

Example:

`http://192.168.x.x:8000`

BuddyDash will connect to your Bambuddy instance and automatically load printers.

---

## Why BuddyDash?

Most printer dashboards either feel:

* overly technical
* cluttered
* desktop-first
* slow to navigate on mobile

BuddyDash was built around a simple idea:

> printer management should feel fast and enjoyable on mobile.

The goal is simple:

* Less friction
* Less menu diving
* More glanceability
* Faster actions

BuddyDash focuses on the things you actually do from your phone every day.
